# Bug Fix Punch List

Living punch list for cross-cutting code bugs, wiring omissions, and small
fixes that don't warrant a spec version bump. Items are grouped by owning spec.

Loop agents: when implementing a spec, check this file for items under that
spec's heading. Fix one per iteration. Delete the item from this file after
fixing and committing.

Items marked `(blocked: ...)` can't be fixed until their dependency resolves —
same convention as tracks.md.

- **Fallback `create_garage` has no collision-retry for auto-generated names.** `garages.rs:291-356` generates a name and goes straight to DB insert — a name collision returns `GARAGE_ALREADY_EXISTS` (409). Spec requires transparent retry up to 3 times with random suffix, then `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
